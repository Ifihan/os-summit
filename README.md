# Open Source Summit - Codespaces Demo

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## Introduction

This repository contains the demo project for my talk on Codespaces. It showcases a basic Django REST Framework application.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd os-summit
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **Linux/macOS:**

        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

    *   **Windows:**

        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Apply database migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

    This will start the Django development server, typically accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

2.  **Access the API (example):**

    While the specific API endpoints are not fully defined in the provided code, you can expect to interact with them via HTTP requests.  For example, if you were to create a model and a corresponding serializer, you could then access it via the Django REST Framework.

## Features

*   Basic Django project setup.
*   Uses Django REST Framework.
*   Demonstrates a simple project structure.

## Configuration

The project's settings are located in the `backend/settings.py` file.  You can configure the database, security settings, and other application-specific configurations there.
